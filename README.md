# MMETSP-analyses
Collection of information used in phylo-transcriptomic analyses of MMETSP diatom RNAseq data. We are currently analyzing diatom transcriptome data generated from the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP) for phylogenomic analyses, including delineating diatom evolutionary relationships and understanding of the interplay of phylogenetic signal and noise in a large transcriptomic dataset.
